Quick Description: 

As a Software Engineering students, we can attest that it could be very difficult sometimes to focus on studying to keep our grades in good shape while trying to searching and applying to well suited jobs that will enhance our knowledge and benefit us on the long run. It is also important to note that with today's competition, finding that job could take a while and could be way harder than it needs to be. Which is why we recommend that Engineering students accross Quebec use the new Jobs2Finesse platform. 

The purpose of this project is to create a career services platform where students (who are looking for jobs) may publish and maintain their portfolios and businesses can post job openings. This enables you to do job seeking from the convenience of your home. This assists both job seekers and employers in reducing the pool of candidates for employment. Additionally, job seekers will have the option to tailor their profiles to the market, helping businesses find specific applicants who fit their requirements. All you need to view the website online is a computer or mobile device with Internet access. All Students and Employers must first make an account on our online career services system before they may log in with their email and password. Students will build or edit their profiles, see job opportunities, and submit applications. Employers will manage their job postings and evaluate applicant materials. This system's login information is highly secure, and no one will be able to break it quickly. Students will be notified when they are summoned for an interview by employers and by employers when they apply to job offers.

The main users:

1. Employer : The employer registers for an account, logs in, browses through applicants, adds job offers, and chooses applicants who have already submitted applications for an offer for an interview.

2. Student: The students register for an account, log in, make a profile, upload their resume, explore job listings, and then apply for those positions.

3. Admin : Finally, the admin oversees all user postings and profiles.

4 user stories from the mentionned users above:

- The website should allow users to register, make a profile, upload resumes and login to their accounts using defined log in information.
- The platform should also allow employers to add job offers that will be visible to students that visit the website after it has been updated. They should also be able to choose applicants for interviews.
- The platform should allow students to apply to job offeres with the resumes that they upload.
- The admin should be able to view all of the job offers as well as the students that have applied to them. 

First sprint description and updates:

During our first team meeting, we have discussed our understanding of the project, got introduced to each other, understood each other's strength's and weaknesses and worked on making the Github repository, inviting all of the members and working on each of our commits. We also discussed what approaches and technologies to use:

TASK DIVISION:

-UX UI Front-end : React.Js (William Nazarian | Github : WilliamNazarian & Cleopatr-Aliak Manoukian : Kaianinja) 
-Back-end : Node.Js (Ziad Elsharkawi | Github : Ziadsharkos & Poula Farid | Github : PaulFarid)
-Database : MongoDB or Firebase (still not certain) (Omar Alshanyour | Github : hellomefriend & Sana Antoun | Github : sanaantoun)

We will be using an Agile development approach through out our project and, to support our project management procedure, we will make use of GitHub, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, and continuous integration. The duration of the project is 10 to 12 weeks.  

The front and back-end will each have 2 team members working on them, while the database part of the project will be worked on by only one person. There will also be one person that will do a bit of front and back end to help get both sides on track and organize how both sides will be able to link their work and make the program functional. 

Plan for next sprint : By the next sprint, we are planing on finishing the web- development courses assigned to team members that have less experience with the mentioned technologies. In addition, we will be discussing  the website front-end design to ensure that it will meet the requirements indicated in the document by understanding how the back-end will be linked to the front-end (i.e how will the database be linked to the website and how the backend functions will retrieve the information from the database). Finally, we will discuss the efficiency of the application by figuring out which data structures or which functions will have less time complexity to use.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
